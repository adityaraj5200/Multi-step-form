## About the App
This application is nothing but a multi-step-form which accepts your First Name, Last Name and Email on it's first page, your City, Occupation and Bio on it's second page, asks for confirmation on it's third page and shows a success message on it's fourth page.
It is only a Frontend project (there is no Backend)

## Motivation to make it
The reason why I built it is because I just finished learning React.js and wanted to make someting out of it in order to brush up and test what I just learned and overall my overall frontend skills.

## Tools and Technologies used
Made using:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* React.js
* VS Code
